# AoC2022

[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). **In Ada, no less!**
Because, after 2019 and 2020, I _still_ haven't learned my lesson.

The elves are on an expedition for reindeer food.

## Day 1: Calorie Counting

Determine which elf/elves have the most calories, and report how many calories.
Part 1 asks for the most calories carried by any one elf.
Part 2 asks for the calories carried by the three elves with the most calories.

## Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors

An elf gives you a strategy guide for playing rock-paper-scissors.
Part 1 has you score the strategy when you play it one way.
Part 2 has you score the strategy when you play it another way.
